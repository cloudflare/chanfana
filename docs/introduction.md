Chanfana is a powerful and lightweight TypeScript library designed to effortlessly bring the benefits of OpenAPI to your web APIs. Built with modern JavaScript runtimes in mind, especially Cloudflare Workers, Chanfana provides schema generation and validation for popular routers like [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) and [itty-router](https://github.com/kwhitley/itty-router), and is adaptable to many more.

## What is Chanfana?

Chanfana, previously known as `itty-router-openapi`, is more than just an OpenAPI generator. It's a comprehensive toolkit that allows you to:

*   **Define your API contracts using TypeScript classes and Zod schemas.** Write your API logic and schema in one place, ensuring type safety and reducing boilerplate.
*   **Automatically generate OpenAPI v3 and v3.1 compliant schemas.**  No more manual schema writing! Chanfana infers your API structure directly from your code.
*   **Enforce request validation.**  Protect your API by automatically validating incoming requests against your defined schemas.
*   **Serve interactive API documentation.**  Chanfana seamlessly integrates with Swagger UI and ReDoc to provide beautiful, interactive documentation for your API consumers.
*   **Extend your existing router applications.**  Integrate Chanfana into your Hono or itty-router projects without rewriting your existing routes.

Chanfana is built to be both powerful and lightweight, making it ideal for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers, but it runs perfectly well in any JavaScript runtime.
